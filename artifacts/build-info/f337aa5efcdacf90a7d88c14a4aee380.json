Note that any function without this setup won't be\n * effectively restricted.\n *\n * The restriction rules for such functions are defined in terms of \"roles\" identified by an `uint64` and scoped\n * by target (`address`) and function selectors (`bytes4`). These roles are stored in this contract and can be\n * configured by admins (`ADMIN_ROLE` members) after a delay (see {getTargetAdminDelay}).\n *\n * For each target contract, admins can configure the following without any delay:\n *\n * * The target's {AccessManaged-authority} via {updateAuthority}.\n * * Close or open a target via {setTargetClosed} keeping the permissions intact.\n * * The roles that are allowed (or disallowed) to call a given function (identified by its selector) through {setTargetFunctionRole}.\n *\n * By default every address is member of the `PUBLIC_ROLE` and every target function is restricted to the `ADMIN_ROLE` until configured otherwise.\n * Additionally, each role has the following configuration options restricted to this manager's admins:\n *\n * * A role's admin role via {setRoleAdmin} who can grant or revoke roles.\n * * A role's guardian role via {setRoleGuardian} who's allowed to cancel operations.\n * * A delay in which a role takes effect after being granted through {setGrantDelay}.\n * * A delay of any target's admin action via {setTargetAdminDelay}.\n * * A role label for discoverability purposes with {labelRole}.\n *\n * Any account can be added and removed into any number of these roles by using the {grantRole} and {revokeRole} functions\n * restricted to each role's admin (see {getRoleAdmin}).\n *\n * Since all the permissions of the managed system can be modified by the admins of this instance, it is expected that\n * they will be highly secured (e.g., a multisig or a well-configured DAO).\n *\n * NOTE: This contract implements a form of the {IAuthority} interface, but {canCall} has additional return data so it\n * doesn't inherit `IAuthority`. It is however compatible with the `IAuthority` interface since the first 32 bytes of\n * the return data are a boolean as expected by that interface.\n *\n * NOTE: Systems that implement other access control mechanisms (for example using {Ownable}) can be paired with an\n * {AccessManager} by transferring permissions (ownership in the case of {Ownable}) directly to the {AccessManager}.\n * Users will be able to interact with these contracts through the {execute} function, following the access rules\n * registered in the {AccessManager}. Keep in mind that in that context, the msg.sender seen by restricted functions\n * will be {AccessManager} itself.\n *\n * WARNING: When granting permissions over an {Ownable} or {AccessControl} contract to an {AccessManager}, be very\n * mindful of the danger associated with functions such as {{Ownable-renounceOwnership}} or\n * {{AccessControl-renounceRole}}.\n */\ncontract AccessManager is Context, Multicall, IAccessManager {\n    using Time for *;\n\n    // Structure that stores the details for a target contract.\n    struct TargetConfig {\n        mapping(bytes4 selector => uint64 roleId) allowedRoles;\n        Time.Delay adminDelay;\n        bool closed;\n    }\n\n    // Structure that stores the details for a role/account pair.

@dev AccessManager is a central contract to store the permissions of a system.\n A smart contract under the control of an AccessManager instance is known as a target, and will inherit from the\n {AccessManaged} contract, be connected to this contract as its manager and implement the {AccessManaged-restricted}\n modifier on a set of functions selected to be permissioned. Note that any function without this setup won't be\n effectively restricted.\n The restriction rules for such functions are defined in terms of \"roles\" identified by an `uint64` and scoped\n by target (`address`) and function selectors (`bytes4`). These roles are stored in this contract and can be\n configured by admins (`ADMIN_ROLE` members) after a delay (see {getTargetAdminDelay}).\n For each target contract, admins can configure the following without any delay:\n * The target's {AccessManaged-authority} via {updateAuthority}.\n * Close or open a target via {setTargetClosed} keeping the permissions intact.\n * The roles that are allowed (or disallowed) to call a given function (identified by its selector) through {setTargetFunctionRole}.\n By default every address is member of the `PUBLIC_ROLE` and every target function is restricted to the `ADMIN_ROLE` until configured otherwise.\n Additionally, each role has the following configuration options restricted to this manager's admins:\n * A role's admin role via {setRoleAdmin} who can grant or revoke roles.\n * A role's guardian role via {setRoleGuardian} who's allowed to cancel operations.\n * A delay in which a role takes effect after being granted through {setGrantDelay}.\n * A delay of any target's admin action via {setTargetAdminDelay}.\n * A role label for discoverability purposes with {labelRole}.\n Any account can be added and removed into any number of these roles by using the {grantRole} and {revokeRole} functions\n restricted to each role's admin (see {getRoleAdmin}).\n Since all the permissions of the managed system can be modified by the admins of this instance, it is expected that\n they will be highly secured (e.g., a multisig or a well-configured DAO).\n NOTE: This contract implements a form of the {IAuthority} interface, but {canCall} has additional return data so it\n doesn't inherit `IAuthority`. It is however compatible with the `IAuthority` interface since the first 32 bytes of\n the return data are a boolean as expected by that interface.\n NOTE: Systems that implement other access control mechanisms (for example using {Ownable}) can be paired with an\n {AccessManager} by transferring permissions (ownership in the case of {Ownable}) directly to the {AccessManager}.\n Users will be able to interact with these contracts through the {execute} function, following the access rules\n registered in the {AccessManager}. Keep in mind that in that context, the msg.sender seen by restricted functions\n will be {AccessManager} itself.\n WARNING: When granting permissions over an {Ownable} or {AccessControl} contract to an {AccessManager}, be very\n mindful of the danger associated with functions such as {{Ownable-renounceOwnership}} or\n {{AccessControl-renounceRole}}."},"fullyImplemented":true,"id":2316,"linearizedBaseContracts":[2316,2794,3164,3077],"name":"AccessManager","nameLocation":"3735:13:2","nodeType":"ContractDefinition","nodes":[{"global":false,"id":455,"libraryName":{"id":454,"name":"Time","nameLocations":["3799:4:2"],"nodeType":"IdentifierPath","referencedDeclaration":6861,"src":"3799:4:2"},"nodeType":"UsingForDirective","src":"3793:17:2"},{"canonicalName":"AccessManager.TargetConfig","id":465,"members":[{"constant":false,"id":459,"mutability":"mutable","name":"allowedRoles","nameLocation":"3952:12:2","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":465,"src":"3910:54:2","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_mapping$_t_bytes4_$_t_uint64_$","typeString":"mapping(bytes4

NOTE: The IAuthority interface does not include the `uint32` delay. This is an extension of that interface that is backward compatible. Some contracts may thus ignore the second return argument.

is a central contract to store the permissions of a system. A smart contract under the control of an AccessManager instance is known as a target, and will inherit from the {AccessManaged} contract, be connected to this contract as its manager and implement the {AccessManaged-restricted} modifier on a set of functions selected to be permissioned. Note that any function without this setup won't be effectively restricted. The restriction rules for such functions are defined in terms of \"roles\" identified by an `uint64` and scoped by target (`address`) and function selectors (`bytes4`). These roles are stored in this contract and can be configured by admins (`ADMIN_ROLE` members) after a delay (see {getTargetAdminDelay}). For each target contract, admins can configure the following without any delay: * The target's {AccessManaged-authority} via {updateAuthority}. * Close or open a target via {setTargetClosed} keeping the permissions intact. * The roles that are allowed (or disallowed) to call a given function (identified by its selector) through {setTargetFunctionRole}. By default every address is member of the `PUBLIC_ROLE` and every target function is restricted to the `ADMIN_ROLE` until configured otherwise. Additionally, each role has the following configuration options restricted to this manager's admins: * A role's admin role via {setRoleAdmin} who can grant or revoke roles. * A role's guardian role via {setRoleGuardian} who's allowed to cancel operations. * A delay in which a role takes effect after being granted through {setGrantDelay}. * A delay of any target's admin action via {setTargetAdminDelay}. * A role label for discoverability purposes with {labelRole}. Any account can be added and removed into any number of these roles by using the {grantRole} and {revokeRole} functions restricted to each role's admin (see {getRoleAdmin}). Since all the permissions of the managed system can be modified by the admins of this instance, it is expected that they will be highly secured (e.g., a multisig or a well-configured DAO). NOTE: This contract implements a form of the {IAuthority} interface, but {canCall} has additional return data so it doesn't inherit `IAuthority`. It is however compatible with the `IAuthority` interface since the first 32 bytes of the return data are a boolean as expected by that interface. NOTE: Systems that implement other access control mechanisms (for example using {Ownable}) can be paired with an {AccessManager} by transferring permissions (ownership in the case of {Ownable}) directly to the {AccessManager}. Users will be able to interact with these contracts through the {execute} function, following the access rules registered in the {AccessManager}. Keep in mind that in that context, the msg.sender seen by restricted functions will be {AccessManager} itself. WARNING: When granting permissions over an {Ownable} or {AccessControl} contract to an {AccessManager}, be very mindful of the danger associated with functions such as {{Ownable-renounceOwnership}} or {{AccessControl-renounceRole}}.","errors":{"AddressEmptyCode(address)":[{"details":"There's no code at `target` (it is not a contract)."}],"AddressInsufficientBalance(address)":[{"details":"The ETH balance of the account is not enough to perform the operation."}],"FailedInnerCall()":[{"details":"A call to an address target failed.

NOTE: The IAuthority interface does not include the `uint32` delay. This is an extension of that interface that is backward compatible. Some contracts may thus ignore the second return argument.

is a central contract to store the permissions of a system. A smart contract under the control of an AccessManager instance is known as a target, and will inherit from the {AccessManaged} contract, be connected to this contract as its manager and implement the {AccessManaged-restricted} modifier on a set of functions selected to be permissioned. Note that any function without this setup won't be effectively restricted. The restriction rules for such functions are defined in terms of \\\"roles\\\" identified by an `uint64` and scoped by target (`address`) and function selectors (`bytes4`). These roles are stored in this contract and can be configured by admins (`ADMIN_ROLE` members) after a delay (see {getTargetAdminDelay}). For each target contract, admins can configure the following without any delay: * The target's {AccessManaged-authority} via {updateAuthority}. * Close or open a target via {setTargetClosed} keeping the permissions intact. * The roles that are allowed (or disallowed) to call a given function (identified by its selector) through {setTargetFunctionRole}. By default every address is member of the `PUBLIC_ROLE` and every target function is restricted to the `ADMIN_ROLE` until configured otherwise. Additionally, each role has the following configuration options restricted to this manager's admins: * A role's admin role via {setRoleAdmin} who can grant or revoke roles. * A role's guardian role via {setRoleGuardian} who's allowed to cancel operations. * A delay in which a role takes effect after being granted through {setGrantDelay}. * A delay of any target's admin action via {setTargetAdminDelay}. * A role label for discoverability purposes with {labelRole}. Any account can be added and removed into any number of these roles by using the {grantRole} and {revokeRole} functions restricted to each role's admin (see {getRoleAdmin}). Since all the permissions of the managed system can be modified by the admins of this instance, it is expected that they will be highly secured (e.g., a multisig or a well-configured DAO). NOTE: This contract implements a form of the {IAuthority} interface, but {canCall} has additional return data so it doesn't inherit `IAuthority`. It is however compatible with the `IAuthority` interface since the first 32 bytes of the return data are a boolean as expected by that interface. NOTE: Systems that implement other access control mechanisms (for example using {Ownable}) can be paired with an {AccessManager} by transferring permissions (ownership in the case of {Ownable}) directly to the {AccessManager}. Users will be able to interact with these contracts through the {execute} function, following the access rules registered in the {AccessManager}. Keep in mind that in that context, the msg.sender seen by restricted functions will be {AccessManager} itself. WARNING: When granting permissions over an {Ownable} or {AccessControl} contract to an {AccessManager}, be very mindful of the danger associated with functions such as {{Ownable-renounceOwnership}} or {{AccessControl-renounceRole}}.\",\"errors\":{\"AddressEmptyCode(address)\":[{\"details\":\"There's no code at `target` (it is not a contract).\"}],\"AddressInsufficientBalance(address)\":[{\"details\":\"The ETH balance of the account is not enough to perform the operation.\"}],\"FailedInnerCall()\":[{\"details\":\"A call to an address target failed.

If `immediate` is true, the delay can be disregarded and the operation can be immediately executed, otherwise the operation can be executed if and only if delay is greater than 0. NOTE: The IAuthority interface does not include the `uint32` delay. This is an extension of that interface that is backward compatible. Some contracts may thus ignore the second return argument. In that case they will fail to identify the indirect workflow, and will consider calls that require a delay to be forbidden.

Note that any function without this setup won't be\\n * effectively restricted.\\n *\\n * The restriction rules for such functions are defined in terms of \\\"roles\\\" identified by an `uint64` and scoped\\n * by target (`address`) and function selectors (`bytes4`). These roles are stored in this contract and can be\\n * configured by admins (`ADMIN_ROLE` members) after a delay (see {getTargetAdminDelay}).\\n *\\n * For each target contract, admins can configure the following without any delay:\\n *\\n * * The target's {AccessManaged-authority} via {updateAuthority}.\\n * * Close or open a target via {setTargetClosed} keeping the permissions intact.\\n * * The roles that are allowed (or disallowed) to call a given function (identified by its selector) through {setTargetFunctionRole}.\\n *\\n * By default every address is member of the `PUBLIC_ROLE` and every target function is restricted to the `ADMIN_ROLE` until configured otherwise.\\n * Additionally, each role has the following configuration options restricted to this manager's admins:\\n *\\n * * A role's admin role via {setRoleAdmin} who can grant or revoke roles.\\n * * A role's guardian role via {setRoleGuardian} who's allowed to cancel operations.\\n * * A delay in which a role takes effect after being granted through {setGrantDelay}.\\n * * A delay of any target's admin action via {setTargetAdminDelay}.\\n * * A role label for discoverability purposes with {labelRole}.\\n *\\n * Any account can be added and removed into any number of these roles by using the {grantRole} and {revokeRole} functions\\n * restricted to each role's admin (see {getRoleAdmin}).\\n *\\n * Since all the permissions of the managed system can be modified by the admins of this instance, it is expected that\\n * they will be highly secured (e.g., a multisig or a well-configured DAO).\\n *\\n * NOTE: This contract implements a form of the {IAuthority} interface, but {canCall} has additional return data so it\\n * doesn't inherit `IAuthority`. It is however compatible with the `IAuthority` interface since the first 32 bytes of\\n * the return data are a boolean as expected by that interface.\\n *\\n * NOTE: Systems that implement other access control mechanisms (for example using {Ownable}) can be paired with an\\n * {AccessManager} by transferring permissions (ownership in the case of {Ownable}) directly to the {AccessManager}.\\n * Users will be able to interact with these contracts through the {execute} function, following the access rules\\n * registered in the {AccessManager}. Keep in mind that in that context, the msg.sender seen by restricted functions\\n * will be {AccessManager} itself.\\n *\\n * WARNING: When granting permissions over an {Ownable} or {AccessControl} contract to an {AccessManager}, be very\\n * mindful of the danger associated with functions such as {{Ownable-renounceOwnership}} or\\n * {{AccessControl-renounceRole}}.\\n */\\ncontract AccessManager is Context, Multicall, IAccessManager {\\n    using Time for *;\\n\\n    // Structure that stores the details for a target contract.\\n    struct TargetConfig {\\n        mapping(bytes4 selector => uint64 roleId) allowedRoles;\\n        Time.Delay adminDelay;\\n        bool closed;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Structure that stores the details for a role/account pair.

NOTE: The IAuthority interface does not include the `uint32` delay. This is an extension of that interface that is backward compatible. Some contracts may thus ignore the second return argument.

The user will only be able to execute the operation after the delay has passed, before it has expired. During this period, admin and guardians can cancel the operation (see {cancel}). If the account has already been granted this role, the execution delay will be updated. This update is not immediate and follows the delay rules.
