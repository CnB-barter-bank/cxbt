These roles are stored in this contract and can be\n * configured by admins (`ADMIN_ROLE` members) after a delay (see {getTargetAdminDelay}).\n *\n * For each target contract, admins can configure the following without any delay:\n *\n * * The target's {AccessManaged-authority} via {updateAuthority}.\n * * Close or open a target via {setTargetClosed} keeping the permissions intact.\n * * The roles that are allowed (or disallowed) to call a given function (identified by its selector) through {setTargetFunctionRole}.\n *\n * By default every address is member of the `PUBLIC_ROLE` and every target function is restricted to the `ADMIN_ROLE` until configured otherwise.\n * Additionally, each role has the following configuration options restricted to this manager's admins:\n *\n * * A role's admin role via {setRoleAdmin} who can grant or revoke roles.\n * * A role's guardian role via {setRoleGuardian} who's allowed to cancel operations.\n * * A delay in which a role takes effect after being granted through {setGrantDelay}.\n * * A delay of any target's admin action via {setTargetAdminDelay}.\n * * A role label for discoverability purposes with {labelRole}.\n *\n * Any account can be added and removed into any number of these roles by using the {grantRole} and {revokeRole} functions\n * restricted to each role's admin (see {getRoleAdmin}).\n *\n * Since all the permissions of the managed system can be modified by the admins of this instance, it is expected that\n * they will be highly secured (e.g., a multisig or a well-configured DAO).\n *\n * NOTE: This contract implements a form of the {IAuthority} interface, but {canCall} has additional return data so it\n * doesn't inherit `IAuthority`.

(See also\n * {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}).\n *\n * Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so\n * contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit.\n */\ninterface IERC20Permit {\n    /**\n     * @dev Sets `value` as the allowance of `spender` over ``owner``'s tokens,\n     * given ``owner``'s signed approval.\n     *\n     * IMPORTANT: The same issues {IERC20-approve} has related to transaction\n     * ordering also apply here.\n     *\n     * Emits an {Approval} event.\n     *\n     * Requirements:\n     *\n     * - `spender` cannot be the zero address.\n     * - `deadline` must be a timestamp in the future.\n     * - `v`, `r` and `s` must be a valid `secp256k1` signature from `owner`\n     * over the EIP712-formatted function arguments.\n     * - the signature must use ``owner``'s current nonce (see {nonces}).\n     *\n     * For more information on the signature format, see the\n     * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612#specification[relevant EIP\n     * section].\n     *\n     * CAUTION: See Security Considerations above.\n     */\n    function permit(\n        address owner,\n        address spender,\n        uint256 value,\n        uint256 deadline,\n        uint8 v,\n        bytes32 r,\n        bytes32 s\n    ) external;\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Returns the current nonce for `owner`.
